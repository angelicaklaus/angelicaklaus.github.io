          <p style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000">I am Angelica Klaus, an Italian student at the University of Geneva.
            <br style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000">Here I have done my bachelor in multilingual communication in the faculty of Translation and Interpreting and now I am continuing my studies with a master in the same faculty.
            <br style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000">I work principally using three languages: Italian, French and English, but I have also studied some German.
            <br style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000">I am passionate about many things in life and among them there are technology, music, dance, books, sports, travels and nature.</p>
